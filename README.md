### Project Title
The project is called "Explore Bike Share Data".

### Description
This project was created as part of the Udacity Nanodegree "Programming for Data Science with R" and explores data about bikesharing in New York City, Chicago, and Washington. To this end, the project relies on R studio and mostly ggplot2 to analyse the data and to answer three interesting questions.

After posing each question, the questions are answered by using appropriate visualizations based on ggplot2 and by complementing them with summary statistics.

The three questions are as follows:
1. To what extent do the trip durations vary between subscribers and customers, looking at the data for New York City?
2. How does the distribution of the trip durations look like for the three cities?
3. How does the duration of trips vary during the week? Do differences between the cities exist?
